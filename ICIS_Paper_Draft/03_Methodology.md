# Methodology

## 3.1 Research Design

Given the exploratory nature of our research questions and the need to understand the subjective experiences of users navigating complex tensions, we adopted a qualitative research design centered on in-depth semi-structured interviews (Myers and Newman 2007). Qualitative methods are particularly appropriate for investigating phenomena where the variables of interest are not yet well-defined and where understanding contextual nuances is essential (Walsham 1995). The trust-use paradox, as an emergent phenomenon without established theoretical explanation, called for an approach that could surface unexpected patterns and enable theory development grounded in rich empirical evidence.

Our epistemological stance draws from the interpretive tradition in IS research, which emphasizes understanding phenomena through the meanings that participants assign to them (Klein and Myers 1999). We sought to understand not only *what* trust patterns emerged, but *how* users made sense of their own trust dynamics and *why* they continued engaging with systems they distrusted. This required careful attention to participants' own language, reasoning, and lived experience.

## 3.2 Participant Recruitment and Sample

Participants were recruited through multiple channels including university mailing lists, professional networks, and targeted outreach to communities known for active GenAI engagement. Recruitment materials sought individuals who: (1) had been using GenAI tools for work-related purposes for at least six months, (2) used these tools at least weekly, and (3) could articulate experiences and reflections about their use patterns. These criteria ensured participants had sufficient experience to observe trust evolution over time.

Recruitment proceeded in waves over a three-month period, with ongoing analysis informing subsequent sampling decisions in accordance with theoretical sampling principles (Glaser and Strauss 1967). We deliberately sought diversity in professional backgrounds, use cases, and initial attitudes toward GenAI to maximize variation and enable cross-case comparison. Recruitment continued until we observed theoretical saturation—the point at which additional interviews yielded diminishing new insights (Guest et al. 2006).

The final sample comprised 49 participants with characteristics summarized in Table 1. The sample spanned diverse professional contexts including academic research, software development, creative industries, business operations, and education. Geographic distribution included participants from Singapore, China, Malaysia, Mexico, and other countries, providing cross-cultural perspectives on GenAI trust dynamics. Experience with GenAI ranged from 1.5 to 5 years, with most participants having begun use shortly after ChatGPT's public release in late 2022.

## 3.3 Data Collection

Data collection occurred through semi-structured interviews conducted between September and December 2024. Interviews lasted between 45 and 90 minutes, with an average duration of approximately 60 minutes. Depending on participant preference and geographic constraints, interviews were conducted either in person or via video conferencing (Zoom). All interviews were audio-recorded with participant consent and subsequently transcribed verbatim.

The interview protocol was organized around several thematic blocks while maintaining flexibility to pursue emergent topics (Rubin and Rubin 2012). Key areas of inquiry included:

1. **Use Context and History**: When and how participants began using GenAI; primary use cases; tools used and why; evolution of use patterns over time.

2. **Trust Evaluation**: Perceived initial trust levels (using a percentage scale as an elicitation device); how trust had changed over time; critical incidents that affected trust; current trust levels across different task types.

3. **Use Strategies**: How participants formulated prompts; verification and validation practices; task types where they did or did not use GenAI; strategies for managing AI limitations.

4. **Concerns and Reflections**: Worries about GenAI use; observations about AI capabilities and limitations; thoughts about skill impacts; future expectations.

5. **Critical Incidents**: Specific experiences that significantly affected their view of GenAI, whether positive or negative.

The percentage-based trust elicitation proved particularly valuable, as it enabled participants to articulate nuanced changes (e.g., "I started at 50% but I'm now around 30%") and facilitated comparison across participants. While we recognize that such self-reported percentages are imprecise, they served as useful anchors for subsequent probing about *why* trust had changed in the reported direction.

Interviews were conducted in participants' preferred language (English or Mandarin Chinese), with Chinese interviews translated during transcription by a bilingual research team member. Translation accuracy was verified through back-translation of selected passages.

## 3.4 Data Analysis

Data analysis followed an iterative thematic analysis approach combining inductive and deductive elements (Braun and Clarke 2006). The process proceeded through several phases:

**Phase 1: Familiarization and Initial Coding.** All transcripts were read multiple times to develop holistic understanding of each participant's narrative. Initial codes were generated inductively, capturing significant statements, patterns, and phenomena in participants' own language. This phase generated over 400 initial codes across the corpus.

**Phase 2: Pattern Identification.** Initial codes were grouped into preliminary themes through constant comparison across cases (Corbin and Strauss 2008). We paid particular attention to instances that seemed contradictory or puzzling—such as participants who reported declining trust but increasing use—as these tensions often signaled theoretically important phenomena.

**Phase 3: Trust Trajectory Mapping.** For each participant, we constructed a narrative "trust trajectory" documenting reported initial trust levels, changes over time, and the events or realizations associated with these changes. This enabled systematic comparison of patterns across the sample and identification of distinct trajectory types.

**Phase 4: Framework Development.** Through iterative movement between data and emerging conceptual categories, we developed the "Triple Paradox" framework that organizes our findings. This framework emerged from repeated observation that participants' experiences clustered around three distinct tensions, each representing a form of paradoxical relationship. Importantly, the framework focuses on paradoxical *dynamics* rather than simple trajectory *categories*. While participants exhibited diverse trust trajectories (rising, declining, steady, bell-curve, task-divergent), the theoretically significant finding was that even participants with opposing trajectories often shared underlying paradoxical dynamics—users whose trust rose and those whose trust fell frequently navigated similar tensions between productivity and skepticism.

**Phase 5: Verification and Refinement.** We returned to transcripts to verify that the framework adequately captured participants' experiences and to identify disconfirming evidence. Illustrative quotes were selected to represent each theme, with attention to including diverse voices rather than over-relying on particularly articulate participants.

To enhance trustworthiness, we employed several techniques recommended for qualitative research (Lincoln and Guba 1985). These included maintaining detailed audit trails documenting analytical decisions, engaging in peer debriefing sessions where emerging interpretations were challenged, and searching for negative cases that might contradict developing themes. All quotes presented in the findings section were verified against original transcripts, with line numbers recorded to ensure traceability.

## 3.5 Ethical Considerations

This study received approval from [Institution Name Redacted for Review] Institutional Review Board. All participants provided informed consent prior to interviews, including consent for audio recording and use of anonymized quotes in publications. Participants were assigned alphanumeric identifiers (R1-R49) to protect confidentiality. Any identifying information mentioned during interviews was removed or altered during transcription. Participants were informed they could withdraw at any time without consequence.
