## 使用场景

### 场景1：代码调试与理解 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "Professionally sometimes in the debuggings...when I have to understand some concepts it actually provides you great resources"

### 场景2：邮件与文本编辑 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "When I'm drafting the emails or like editing some passages or I have to change my tone"

**策略**：
> "For email...I just want a first draft and then I can edit it by myself"

### 场景3：概念学习与类比 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**独特方法**：
> "If I have some things I don't understand...I asked to give me an analogy of it so that it solidifies my thinking"

**效果评价**：
> "Using those analogies, I'm able to remember the concepts in a much simpler way"

### 场景4：信息整合 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用动机**：
> "It has an advantage that it can consolidate all the information. I don't have to switch to different tabs"

## 信任轨迹：快速提升型

### 信任演变 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "When I got started it was around like 22-23ish...at that time it was quite low"
> "As these days it's getting better...now you can get the citations and references...that has raised some of my trust"
> "I would say around 80 percent"

**从20-30%提升到80%**

### 信任提升原因

**1. 技术进步**：
> "They're making it more trustable and it's expanding a lot"

**2. 引用功能**：
> "Now you can get the citations and references like where exactly it is coming from"

## 核心专家策略

### 策略1：角色分配策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I usually try to assign a role to it so that it doesn't go in other directions"
> "Say you're an expert in data scientist...then I assigned that particular role"

### 策略2：上下文提供策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I try to give it some context as well"

### 策略3：类比请求策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I asked to give me an analogy of it so that it solidifies my thinking"

### 策略4：迭代追问策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I can just say...it's more of like I have a structured thing"
> "I'm able to get like something solid in under three to five"

## 深层认知

### 对AI优势的理解 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**生成初稿**：
> "Originating the first drafts or like providing some ideas to get started with"

### 对AI局限的认识 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**信息过载问题**：
> "Sometimes if I just provided too much information...less creative freedom"

**幻觉问题**：
> "It sometimes misses the concepts and hallucinates sometimes"

### 对过度依赖的警惕 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I have tasks where I want to just be myself and I feel like maybe relying a bit on it too much is impacting"
> "I try to come up with the drafts myself...restrict a bit of it"

## 独特发现

### 1. 类比学习法 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "With the analogy and those kind of stuff, I'm able to understand the concept"

**理论价值**：AI辅助学习的创新应用

### 2. 多资源免费版策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "There are so many multiple resources, I feel like I can make use of the different free versions to fulfill whatever I want to accomplish"
