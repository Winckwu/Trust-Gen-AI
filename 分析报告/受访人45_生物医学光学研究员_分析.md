## 使用场景

### 场景1：代码调试与注释 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐（核心场景）

**使用方式**：
> "I write my own codes. I don't generate the codes...but I do use it to fix some very minor issues"
> "For codes I use Claude...I just needed some assistance to make it quicker"

**工具选择**：
> "I don't really trust...I don't really use ChatGPT for most of my coding...I've always use Claude because I feel that Claude is much better at this kind of engineering"

### 场景2：学术写作辅助 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "Sometimes we have a writer's block...to get an initial perspective"
> "I just maybe start off with some paragraphs...I don't let it write the methods"

### 场景3：文献整理 ⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "20 big text references that I need from Google Scholar...I just go to ChatGPT"
> "I upload all the papers I've already read and let me review it specifically"

## 信任轨迹：渐进提升型（有上限）

### 信任演变 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Initially...that will be around 30, 35%"
> "I would say around 60%...a lot to be desired, but I think this is good"

**从35%提升到60%**

### 信任上限认知 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I will never completely be able to trust it. Maybe my cap will be around 75%, whatever it does"

### 信任提升原因

> "It started really changing when I started developing my own AI algorithms for certain tasks"
> "By that time, there were more advances...people started doing things with ChatGPT"

## 核心专家策略

### 策略1：项目分区策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I already compartmentalize into projects that I'm working on"
> "I create these projects...before you even give an initial prompt, you can upload so many files"

**效果**：
> "There is a lot of cross talk...it was easier for me to just compartmentalize"

### 策略2：丰富信息提示策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I am very particular about all the information I gave in the beginning itself because I notice that helps a lot"
> "I try to give as much information as possible and try to use as good English as possible"

### 策略3：小块调试策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I don't do it like the for the entire code. I do it like in small part so that I can actually verify what exactly is happening"

### 策略4：工具分工策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "For codes I use Claude...if there is some extensive writing to do...I just go to ChatGPT"

### 策略5：边界设定策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Set the tone and the limits of which it can...it shouldn't cross certain red lines"
> "Don't write any code. Yeah, just tell me what you think these errors are"

## 深层认知

### 对AI能力边界的理解 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "It does not have the intuition that you have, which you gain from working in this in a particular field for a long time"
> "If you don't really understand what you're doing...I think it's going to be a very bad outcome"

### 对依赖程度的认知 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I do not want them to...I, in the end of the day, I don't want to forget writing"
> "What this gen AI is to me is nothing more than a convenience"

### 对年轻人使用AI的担忧 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I do teach sometimes...a concern is that they've used a lot of AI. And I think that is very bad for critical thinking"
> "Chat GPT tends to make you feel better...you will be so disconnected"

## 独特发现

### 1. 信任上限理论 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I will never completely be able to trust it. Maybe my cap will be around 75%"

**理论价值**：用户对AI信任存在心理上限，不会随技术进步无限增长

### 2. 跨对话污染发现 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "There is a lot of cross talk. Like I might be working on two or three different things...I did notice that there was a lot of cross stuff"

**理论价值**：用户发现AI记忆功能可能导致不同项目间信息混淆

### 3. 准确性优先于速度 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "What I want is accuracy at a fast pace...accuracy. I do not want anything else"

### 4. 社交隔离担忧 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "The worst part is you will be radicalized because somebody is reinforcing your thoughts without any discussion with anybody else"

**理论价值**：对AI强化用户既有观点、减少人际交流的担忧

## 对论文的核心价值

### 1. 信任上限模型

用户即使技术进步也有固定的信任天花板（75%）

### 2. 开发AI算法促进信任

> "It started really changing when I started developing my own AI algorithms"

### 3. 项目分区策略

作为避免"cross talk"的专家策略

### 关键引用（可用于论文）

1. **信任上限**：
   > "I will never completely be able to trust it. Maybe my cap will be around 75%"

2. **信任提升**：
   > "Initially...around 30, 35%...I would say around 60%"

3. **工具定位**：
   > "What this gen AI is to me is nothing more than a convenience"

4. **教育担忧**：
   > "I think that is very bad for critical thinking, especially in the formative years"

5. **直觉缺失**：
   > "It does not have the intuition that you have"
