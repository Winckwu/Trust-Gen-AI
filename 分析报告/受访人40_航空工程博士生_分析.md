## 使用场景

### 场景1：学术论文搜索 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐（核心场景）

**使用方式**：
> "I use Chat GBD to help me to collate the relevant papers in the relevant fields"
> "It can be a lot more specific compared to using Google Scholar"

**具体优势**：
> "If I wanna a paper on specifically on an aircraft of like 1 meter wing span, I wouldn't be able to find it to Google Scholar"
> "Sometimes the papers that I need...not very well cited...I need stuff that is not well cited at all"

### 场景2：代码调试（有保留）⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "I ask ChatGPT...give it an example code...ask it to base it off that"

**经验教训**：
> "I found a very critical error in the formulation by GPT...my trust went down"

## 信任轨迹：任务差异化信任型

### 信任水平 ⭐⭐⭐

> "6 out of 10"

### 任务差异化 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**搜索任务**：
> "For the research paper kind of task...my trust has gone up...more or less in line with what I think"

**编程任务**：
> "For coding, especially engineering and math...my trust has gone down"
> "I found a very critical error in the formulation by GPT"

## 核心专家策略

### 策略1：提示词精心设计 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I will like right now and comment what are the information I need...try to craft the prompt in a way that ChatGPT will understand me"

### 策略2：初步提供80%信息 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Most of the time, I think I provide like maybe 80% of what CGP team will from me"

### 策略3：快速理智检查 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I at least read through...give a sanity check...I read if the content makes sense"

### 策略4：任务拆分 ⭐⭐⭐

> "Maybe two parts"

## 深层认知

### 开始使用的动机 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Two factors. One was all my peers were using it...peer pressure is one"
> "The other one would be...I wasn't finding what I needed to find with Google"

### 对AI角色的理解 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "It almost feels that way...but I still need to craft my prompts in a way that ChatGPT can understand me"
> "Maybe in between...like in between" (human and computer)

### 对AI过度自信的观察 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "ChatGPT mostly sounds very confident...I wonder if it's just the programming behind"

## 独特发现

### 1. 任务差异化信任 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "For research paper...trust has gone up...for coding...trust has gone down"

**理论价值**：用户对同一工具的信任可以按任务类型分化

### 2. 特定领域搜索优势 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I wouldn't be able to find it to Google Scholar because...they rank base on citation...I need stuff not well cited"

**理论价值**：AI可以发现被传统搜索忽略的长尾内容

### 3. 关键错误经历影响 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I found a very critical error in the formulation"

**理论价值**：单次严重错误可以显著降低特定领域的信任

## 对论文的核心价值

### 1. 任务差异化信任模型

同一用户对不同任务类型的信任可以分化

### 2. 长尾内容搜索优势

AI在发现非热门但相关内容方面的独特价值

### 建议与担忧

> "First step would be don't trust everything that it tells you"
> "The second thing would be to craft your prompts clearly"

### 数据安全担忧 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Not knowing what goes on behind the scenes, where the data goes"
> "I have not really prompted anything about my research, as in like my core parts of the research yet"

### 关键引用（可用于论文）

1. **任务差异化信任**：
   > "For research paper...trust has gone up...for coding...trust has gone down"

2. **长尾搜索优势**：
   > "Papers that I need are not very well cited...I need stuff not well cited"

3. **数据安全担忧**：
   > "I have not prompted anything about my core parts of the research"

4. **新手建议**：
   > "Don't trust everything...craft your prompts clearly"
