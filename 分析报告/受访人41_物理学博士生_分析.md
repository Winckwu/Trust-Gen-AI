## 使用场景

### 场景1：代码开发 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐（核心场景）

**使用方式**：
> "My work completely relies on like theoretical computation"
> "Claude...primarily for the coding kind of things. According that it's useful"

**策略**：
> "I just go blindly to the AI tools and say, okay, what is this towards this...it's an exploration thing"
> "After some time...my prompts get more and more restricted, more and more specific"

### 场景2：论文阅读辅助 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "I'll just upload it...give me the...tell me the story. Tell me why they're doing this. What is the novelty"

**交互式学习**：
> "Explain in sections only when I've understood the section, ask me questions...if I answer correctly, then only you should move to the next section"

### 场景3：考试准备 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**创意应用**：
> "I downloaded the question papers, I gave it to him. Assume you're a professor. How will you change these questions"

## 信任轨迹：显著下降型

### 信任演变 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Actually, it was very high earlier days...75%"
> "Now it's gone down...now it's like 40 percentage"

**从75%降到40%**

### 信任下降原因

**1. 长期使用看到错误**：
> "You use it for a long time and you obviously see the mistakes it makes"

**2. 尴尬经历**：
> "I generated a bunch of theory with the help of AI...went and showed it to my professor...he started pointing out the mistakes"
> "I felt so stupid that day"

**3. 永远自信的问题**：
> "Every time it's like fully confident. And I would say, no, it's wrong. It's like, oh my bad, sorry...you're absolutely right. And then it will give the next wrong answer"

## 核心专家策略

### 策略1：探索到精确的渐进策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "First...exploration thing...after some time...prompts get more and more restricted, more and more specific"
> "The last step of my workflow doesn't involve AI at all"

### 策略2：逐行代码审查 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "After I have about the full code, I know it's working, I manually go in check every line"
> "Does it make sense? Does it make sense?"

### 策略3：模块化代码请求 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "When it tends to write longer pieces of code, it tends to lose more information"
> "I'd rather have it built up piece by piece"

### 策略4：避免领域特定术语 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "At this point, you shouldn't bring very technical terms into it"
> "The moment I say something about light or something, it just pulls in all information from lights"

### 策略5：提供具体示例 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Giving examples in prompts...first I need to give the background"
> "Step by step...in steps"

### 策略6：角色分配策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Imagine that you're a professor looking at this work. What all would you want me to explain more?"

## 深层认知

### 对AI代码能力的矛盾认知 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "It's a dilemma because I know it can go better than me"
> "But the dilemma is that with something so good can produce very bad results"
> "It depends on you" (prompt engineering能力)

### 对AI"作弊"行为的观察 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "These LLMs, they're just trying to do one thing, that is to give you the answer"
> "They will do all sorts of cheating methods to give you that answer"

### 对过度自信的强烈批评 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "At no point is it like, okay, I'm not sure about the answer"
> "I can't because I know it gets it wrong"
> "Even if tomorrow it says, okay, I'm not sure about it, still I wouldn't trust it"

## 独特发现

### 1. 工作流最后阶段排除AI ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "The last part is just not using AI at all"

**理论价值**：即使重度使用AI，关键验证阶段仍需人工

### 2. "作弊"行为洞察 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "They will do all sorts of cheating methods to give you that answer"

**理论价值**：用户认识到AI会以任何方式达成目标

### 3. 交互式学习设计 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Explain in sections...ask me questions...if I answer correctly, then only move to the next section"

**理论价值**：用户可以设计复杂的学习交互模式

### 4. 专业术语避免策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "The moment I say something about light...it just pulls in all information"

**理论价值**：领域术语可能导致AI过度联想

## 对论文的核心价值

### 1. 信任显著下降案例

从75%到40%的信任下降轨迹

### 2. 逐行代码审查实践

极度严谨的验证方法

### 3. AI"作弊"行为认知

对AI优化输出策略的深刻理解

### 关键引用（可用于论文）

1. **信任下降**：
   > "It was very high earlier days...75%...now it's like 40 percentage"

2. **尴尬经历**：
   > "I showed it to my professor...he pointed out the mistakes...I felt so stupid"

3. **AI作弊**：
   > "They will do all sorts of cheating methods to give you that answer"

4. **最后阶段排除AI**：
   > "The last part is just not using AI at all"

5. **过度自信批评**：
   > "Every time it's like fully confident...at no point is it like I'm not sure"
