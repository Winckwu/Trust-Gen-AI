## 使用场景

### 场景1：资源搜索与整理 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐（核心场景）

**使用方式**：
> "Mainly I use it for resources. I'll just open everything it ask me to open"

**效率提升**：
> "I usually used to have multiple tabs for different keywords...but now it's just one tab"

### 场景2：代码开发 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "I'm using the extensive...Cloud Code credits. So this is how I code. I'll just code everything through cloud code"

**策略转变**：
> "Overtime, as I see how it's not as good...I kind of revert to my old way of working now"

### 场景3：论文总结（已弃用）⭐⭐⭐

**过去使用**：
> "I used to do...usually I used to have it summarize for me"

**现在改变**：
> "I found that its summarization is not actually as good as my reading comprehension"

## 信任轨迹：钟形曲线型（先升后降）⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### 信任演变 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "It follows like bell curve or something"
> "Initially...around 20%. Then I think peak in 2024...maybe 80% or 90% even in the peak"
> "Now I think it's like 20%"

**从20%→80-90%→20%**

### 信任下降原因

**1. 期望提高**：
> "Your expectation also increase...expectation disappointment, expectation disappointment"

**2. 深入理解局限**：
> "Because I'm quite involved in the field of AI...I read literatures or interviews...that talk about limitation"

**3. 心智模型形成**：
> "I have better mental model on what kind of task I can assign it"

## 核心专家策略

### 策略1：任务适配策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Now I know better what kind of task it is supposed to do"
> "I use it for something that is...repetitive task...not cognitively challenging"

### 策略2：写作自主策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Right now I try not to write with ChatGPT. My writing is entirely done by me"
> "I think it's quite the...cognitively then dangerous"

### 策略3：记忆功能利用 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "GPT has this thing called memory mode. It can refer to your conversations"

### 策略4：风险评估策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "It depends on...the risk level...if there's no risk...I'll just do it"

## 深层认知：认知危害意识 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### 对意图表达能力的担忧 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I feel that I lose my first, my value"
> "I lose the ability to convey my intention properly"
> "More complex intentions, I...I lost it"

### 对社会影响的深刻反思 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "ChatGPT is an AI product...similar patterns...social media, it's an AI product and it's not good for society overall"
> "In 10 years time, I'm not sure if we're going to judge it the same"

### 对认知能力退化的警示 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "If you outsource everything there, especially your writing...you won't be able to convey your intentions very effectively"
> "If you don't know what you want, then who knows...I don't think happy that way"

## 独特发现

### 1. 钟形信任曲线 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "It follows like bell curve"

**理论价值**：信任可以先升后降，取决于期望管理和深入了解

### 2. 主动戒断行为 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I wean myself off this habit of depending on it"

**理论价值**：用户可以主动减少依赖

### 3. AI产品社会影响类比 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Social media is actually meant to connect us, but people feel more disconnected than ever"

**理论价值**：将GenAI与社交媒体的社会影响进行类比

### 4. 给新手的建议 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "First, don't use it too extensively"
> "Use it for something that...doesn't require higher order thinking skills"
> "Third is maybe don't do your writing with GPT"
