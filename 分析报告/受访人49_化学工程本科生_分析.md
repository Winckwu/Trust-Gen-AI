## 使用场景

### 场景1：研究项目支持 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐（核心场景）

**使用方式**：
> "How to separate a and B and below that...find me a few articles"
> "We also use quite heavily on guiding us with how we go about working with the software"

**具体应用**：
> "This distillation column...is it suitable for us to model this separation?"
> "It can actually guide us very well"

### 场景2：学术写作辅助 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "I will generate my own ideas and then I will throw into Ji and us to refine"
> "Ask to refine, ask to check grammar, ask for like maybe some creative ideas"

**迭代策略**：
> "Refine my essay to make it flow smoother, make it more grammatically correct"

### 场景3：学习理解支持 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "In my election notes, right, this part I don't understand...I take a screenshot and I send it in"
> "I ask to explain how step 1 goes to step 2"

### 场景4：演讲与呈现 ⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "Can you help me refine my speech in a more creative way or more engaging way"

## 信任轨迹：使用后大幅提升型

### 信任演变 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "When I first heard about it, percent" [约10%]
> "Around like six, 70% increase in trust"

**从约10%提升到70-80%**

### 信任提升原因

> "As I use it, right, I realize it can actually solve more and more problems"
> "Then that's why my reliance on this AI tool becomes more and more"

### 仍存在的问题

**数学计算错误**：
> "Using like 5*2 equals to 11...mathematics, very simple error"
> "I say, okay, use the value of t equals to 5. It will use, let's say it will use 6"

**假设行为**：
> "If I give them limited information that they cannot work with, right? They just assume things and they just proceed"

## 核心专家策略

### 策略1：上下文+指令分层策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I'm showing the whole paragraph and then below, right, I will give the specific instruction"
> "My bottom paragraph is usually set up instruction that I delge chat unity to do with my work"

### 策略2：分段处理策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I will copy paste paragraph by paragraph. I will say, okay, now summarize this paragraph, summarize that paragraph"
> "If this doesn't work right, then I will go more in detail to sentence"

### 策略3：指令重发策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "By the third prom, right...it will start to be less and less already"
> "I always need to remind...I always need to send again the instruction"

**原因**：
> "In a way, make it consider as a new prom"

### 策略4：主动请求澄清策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "At the bottom in the instruction, I will say like, okay, if any information is not present, right, let me know"

### 策略5：自我对比验证策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "First list down what is my working. Put it into chat GBT. And then I use chat GBT as a comparison"
> "To see who is actually correct"

## 深层认知

### 对依赖程度的认知 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "More heavy reliance on chat DBT"
> "Almost certain extent. I have to agree" [无法离开]

### 对批判性思维影响的认知 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "In some of the cases that I'm supposed to think more critically, right, then it becomes that chat ability is thinking for me"
> "I can save up quite a bit of time and can use this for other purpose"

### 对兴趣与委托的权衡 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "If the topic is my interested topic, then yeah, I guess you don't mind doing this kind of deep thinking"
> "But sometimes assignments...they're really...pretty like pointless. So then I don't want to waste my brain"

### 对控制感的维护 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "That's why I do fact checking"
> "Let's say I think this doesn't suit me, then I will from in a way that they generate a response I prefer better"

## 独特发现

### 1. 上下文漂移现象 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "By the third prom, right...it will start to be less and less already"
> "Meaning they paraphrase, less and less is more towards the original text"

**理论价值**：用户发现AI在连续类似任务中效果递减

### 2. 假设而非询问倾向 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "If I give them limited information that they cannot work with, right? They just assume things and they just proceed"
> "Very rarely" [AI请求澄清]

**理论价值**：AI倾向于假设缺失信息而非主动询问

### 3. 兴趣驱动的委托决策 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Interested topic...I don't mind doing this kind of deep thinking"
> "Pointless...I don't want to waste my brain"

**理论价值**：用户基于个人兴趣决定是否委托AI

### 4. 参考而非答案的定位 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Use GI as a reference, not as the answer script itself"
> "Definitely still need to go through your own level of thinking"

### 5. 软件引导应用 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Guiding us with how we go about working with the software [Aspen Plus]"

**理论价值**：AI作为专业软件使用的引导者

## 对论文的核心价值

### 1. 上下文漂移发现

AI在连续任务中效果递减的现象

### 2. 假设vs询问行为

AI处理不完整信息的方式

### 3. 兴趣导向的委托模式

用户基于兴趣选择性使用AI

### 关键引用（可用于论文）

1. **信任提升**：
   > "When I first heard about it, percent [~10%]...six, 70% increase in trust"

2. **批判性思维影响**：
   > "Chat ability is thinking for me"

3. **上下文漂移**：
   > "By the third prom...it will start to be less and less already"

4. **假设行为**：
   > "They just assume things and they just proceed"

5. **参考定位**：
   > "Use GI as a reference, not as the answer script itself"
