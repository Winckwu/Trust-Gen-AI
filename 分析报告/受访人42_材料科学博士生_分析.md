## 使用场景

### 场景1：实验方案验证 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐（核心场景）

**使用方式**：
> "If this protocol I'm using, I'm not sure is it correct...I will type out, then ask him to check for me"
> "Cite if there is any other paper that is related to what I have written"

### 场景2：语法检查与改写 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "Paraphrasing...grammar check"

### 场景3：文献搜索 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "If I want to find any paper is related, then I will ask for the title"

### 场景4：论文理解 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "Can you summarize this kind of paper? What is it about...Then after you read, you don't really understand. They can ask question"

**与Google Scholar对比**：
> "ChatGPT can give you some insights if you ask more...helping you to understand"
> "Scholar just give you the article, won't tell you to interpret"

## 信任轨迹：使用后提升型

### 信任演变 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Maybe 60% of trust...because anyways, this machine, right, not a human"
> "After I use, maybe it's around 80%"

**从60%提升到80%**

### 信任提升原因

> 使用体验验证了工具的实用性

## 核心专家策略

### 策略1：宽问窄答策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I will ask a general question and see what's the respond first. Then after that, I will ask bit by bit"

### 策略2：逻辑验证策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "By the answer that they give me...it's not very logical to my thinking. That's why I will check"
> "If seems logical, then I won't check"

**验证标准**：
> "I use some of my personal understanding and emotion"

### 策略3：多源验证策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I will also check online like the normal Google search"
> "Most importantly, check with my mentor. So a human"

### 策略4：追问确认策略 ⭐⭐⭐

> "I will keep asking question until I as are you sure is correct"

## 深层认知

### 对AI优势的理解 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**知识广度**：
> "For the new things that I don't really know. I think ChatGPT knows more than what we think of"
> "If I would want to know things outside my study, he is better than me"

### 对人类优势的理解 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**实践经验**：
> "I might be better in terms of like practical kind of stuff"
> "ChatGPT give you the protocol, but don't really tell you about what are some things that you can really face when you're doing the experiment"

**情感支持**：
> "My friend told me that she talk to ChatGPT after she broke up...for us, we will ask question...it's more emotional stuff"

### 对依赖程度的认知 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I don't think that I'm highly dependent on that"
> "I think I got balance between it"
> "What you face might not be what on their degree...So that's the point you need to solve yourself"

## 独特发现

### 1. 逻辑一致性作为验证标准 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Not very logical to my thinking...that's why I will check"

**理论价值**：用户依赖直觉来决定是否需要验证

### 2. 实践经验vs理论知识 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Protocol but don't tell you about what you can really face"

**理论价值**：AI擅长理论但缺乏实验实践智慧

### 3. 情感支持的局限性 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "AI type of wording...for us, we will ask question...why do you think so"

**理论价值**：人类情感支持的不可替代性

### 4. 持续控制感 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I'm the one who always ask questions. So I think I'm the one who's controlling"

## 对论文的核心价值

### 1. 实验科学应用案例

生物材料领域的具体应用场景

### 2. 理论vs实践的区分

对AI知识局限性的深刻理解

### 3. 平衡使用的自我评估

用户对自身依赖程度的清醒认知

### 关键引用（可用于论文）

1. **信任提升**：
   > "Maybe 60%...after I use, maybe 80%"

2. **理论vs实践**：
   > "Protocol but don't tell you about what you can really face when doing the experiment"

3. **逻辑验证**：
   > "Not very logical to my thinking...that's why I will check"

4. **控制感**：
   > "I'm the one who always ask questions...I'm controlling"

5. **平衡认知**：
   > "I don't think highly dependent...I got balance between it"
