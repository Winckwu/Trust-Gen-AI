## 使用场景

### 场景1：信息搜索与文献整理 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐（核心场景）

**使用方式**：
> "I would go on Web of Science...read through their overlying abstracts...upload them all at the same time to a specific model. And then ask them to summarize"

**独特策略**：
> "I need to give it documents that it can read and just contain itself within that context first"

### 场景2：代码生成与调试 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "Make a function in Python that has this input...this output...generate the function"

**局限认知**：
> "If I give it the whole code, then 80% of the time I would spend more time debugging what it gave me"

### 场景3：邮件写作 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "If I want to write an email...I don't want to spend time being polite or constructing the grammar, I can just write me this email"

### 场景4：图片生成辅助 ⭐⭐⭐

**使用方式**：
> "If I'm writing a paper and I want some ideas for a figure...give it a sample image or make an outline on PowerPoint"

## 信任轨迹：稳定怀疑型

### 信任水平 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "In the beginning...percentage, zero, no trust, 100%, like a lot of trust, I would say like maybe 50%"
> "It has remained the same, actually. It hasn't changed"

### 不信任的核心原因

**1. 过度自信的错误回答**：
> "It will confidently give you wrong answers that doesn't make any sense"
> "Chad GPT confidently said, yeah, you're right, it is wrong, and then gave me another wrong answer"

**2. 立即妥协不争辩**：
> "If it can argue with me, then I would have a higher trust"
> "They will not just fall in line every time you question it"

**3. 技术原理认知**：
> "I know how it's trained...I've also downloaded the LLM, the free ones and then run them on my computer"
> "I know the exact databases they were trained on"

## 核心专家策略

### 策略1：上下文限定策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I can't trust it to give me information directly from the internet. I need to give it documents that it can read and just contain itself within that context first"

**核心逻辑**：通过提供特定文档限制AI的回答范围

### 策略2：对话刷新策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I do tend to refresh and generate a new chat as well after 15 prompts because I don't really trust the responses after that"
> "I know that after 15, it will start to hallucinate and forget the previous information"

### 策略3：多工具分工策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "GPT is good for certain coding tasks...Gemini Pro is better at writing tasks. Perplexity is better at writing more human-based text"
> "It's not really a good idea to use one of them for everything because they tend to fail miserably for certain tasks"

### 策略4：提示编辑策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "If I get an answer that I don't like, I just edit my original prompt and then make sure it doesn't include what he wrote"

### 策略5：每次验证策略 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Every time, every time...I have to, like if I'm writing it for a paper...I can't put stuff in a paper without verifying it"

## 深层认知

### 对AI能力边界的理解 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "It's really good in very short contexts...very bad when you wanted to use it to learn something new"
> "It will never give you exact information, it's very general"

### 对训练数据局限的认识 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "Websites allowed them to scrape all the text that they needed. Now they don't allow that. So they just kind of keep training it on their own text"

### 对学术引用问题的警惕 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "LLMs tend to hallucinate a lot of citations. That's still a problem today"

## 独特发现

### 1. 稳定的中等信任水平 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "It has remained the same, actually. It hasn't changed"

**理论价值**：信任水平可以长期保持稳定，不一定随使用增加

### 2. 基于技术原理的信任校准 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "I know the context window of this LLM is this much...I know that after 15, it will start to hallucinate"

**理论价值**：技术知识影响用户的信任预期和使用策略

### 3. "争辩能力"作为信任标准 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "If it can argue with me, then I would have a higher trust"

**理论价值**：用户期望AI能坚持正确立场，而非一味同意

### 4. 对认知依赖的担忧 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

> "They rely on the chat GPT to do a lot of the thinking. That's not going to end well for them"
> "Their own ability to cognitively discern what information is correct, incorrect, is going to go down"

## 对论文的核心价值

### 1. 技术专家的信任校准模式

深度理解AI技术原理的用户会形成更稳定、更理性的信任预期

### 2. 多工具策略的理论意义

专家用户发展出根据任务特性分配不同工具的复杂策略

### 3. 验证行为的普遍性

> "I cannot build my knowledge base on something that I'm not sure with"

### 关键引用（可用于论文）

1. **稳定信任**：
   > "In the beginning...maybe 50%...It has remained the same, actually"

2. **争辩期望**：
